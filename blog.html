                        <h3>1. For trying to get into a coding job</h3>
                        <p>
                            As I was leaving my previous company (due to redudancy), I booked a 1-1 meeting with my CTO to ask for some advice on how I can best tackle my next steps. I firstly realised that firmware engineering probably wasn't for me, and that I'd like to switch
                            to a different industry - web development. He said:.
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <div class="quote-image"></div>
                            <div class="quote">
                                <p>"<strong>Find your hook.</strong> Most people will take the general full-stack course. But if you can take several extra courses, like front-end, or cloud courses on AWS or Google, depending on the company you're applying
                                    to, then that will make you stand out."</p>

                        <p>
                            Therefore, if I can learn how to, not only make a fully functioning website, but make it pretty and beautiful, then I think that can give me the "hook" in applying for positions in companies.

                        <h3>2. When in the job</h3>
                        <p>
                            I told my intern during his first day: "I think 50% of the time at work is work, and 50% of time you're just talking about the work.", and he looked at me and laughed. </p>
                        <p>

                            I was working together with Peter, a senior cloud engineer, on creating a CI/CD pipeline for one of our tech stacks. I had briefly discussed the plan of writing a new custom docker image to use for the environment of our pipeline, and he went off and
                            started creating this. The next day I we chatted and I said "whoa whoa just a moment, there was another option - to use an existing, already-maintained, docker image, so that we don't have to maintain our own one." We had a
                            reflection after that and he said to me...
                        </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <div class="quote-image"></div>
                            <div class="quote">
                                <p>"Everyone has a different reality. Its very easy for people to assume things and go off on a race (like me going off and creating a docker image). <strong>Seek first to understand, then to be understood.</strong> This is
                                    a 'pipeline' in itself - the sooner the pipeline fails, the better it is for everybody. Software is a conversation."</p>
                                <p class="author">- Peter</p>
                            </div>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Therefore, after that moment, I made sure to always involve the stakeholders and discuss the design thoroughly, agree upon it, before going off and implementing at my own pace. If there were any moments where I realise the design has to change, I would
                            re-involve the stakeholders in that discussion. <strong>Nothing should be a surprise!</strong>

                            Infact, the book, Mythical-Man-Month (see sidebar), agrees with this. The author says when he estimates, he roughly does by:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1/3 time to planning</li>
                            <li>1/6 to coding</li>
                            <li>1/4 component testing</li>
                            <li>1/4 system testing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            in contrast to junior engineers who would just estimate based on coding time (and subsequently always deliver late).
                            <strong>The coding is only one-sixth of the time spent!</strong>
                        </p>

                        <h3>4. When trying to innovate</h3>
                        <p>
                            I got quite frustrated when I was trying to take the initiative with some improvements I felt were needed, but I mostly got resistance from colleagues and senior colleagues. I spoke to a friend, Georgia, a consultant, about it and she showed me this graph:
                        </p>
                        <div class="blog-image" id="brexit-image"></div>
                        <p>
                            She explained that no-one likes change. When a change is suddenly introduced, people will go into shock - as in the graph - and people will be averse to that. The more you can do to get people's buy in, from the very start of that journey, rather than
                            imposing that change at the end, the better. </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <div class="quote-image"></div>
                            <div class="quote">
                                <p>"Define the problem as clearly as possible, and let others come to your solution by their own way."</p>
                                <p class="author">- Georgia</p>
                            </div>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            For example, hosting a focus group or brainstorm. She said a useful method is to approach each sponsor in private and have a conversation with them about why you are going for a certain initiative. They can advocate for the change and for you because
                            of your personal relationship with them - but you'll need to <strong>convince them of the WHY of your change</strong>.
