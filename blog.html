      <h2>Three pieces of wisdom from senior developers to junior developers</h2>
      <ol>
      <section>    
        <h3>1. For trying to get into a coding job</h3>
        <p>
          As I was leaving my previous company (due to redudancy), I booked a 1-1 meeting with my CTO to ask for some advice on how I can best tackle my next steps of switching from being a firmware engineer to being a web developer.

          Furthermore the application process, its basically about building trust. Company hire trustworthy and knowledgable people.

        <h3>2. When in the job</h3>
        <p>
          I think atleast 50% of the time at work, you're actually talking about work.
          I was working together with a senior engineer... he went off and started creating a docker image from scratch... I said whoa whoa hold on, there was another option - to use an existing docker image and to just download our dependencies into it.
          We had a reflection after that and he said to me...

          Infact, the book, Mythical-Man-Month (see sidebar), agrees with this. The whole software process is:
          Another cool thing he said was around estimation. He says when he estimates, he roughly does by:
          1/3 time to planning
          1/6 to coding
          1/4 component testing
          1/4 system testing
          in contrast to junior engineers would just estiamte based on coding time
          The coding is only 1 sixth of the time spent!

         

          Furthermore, I competed in a leetcode -link- competition last weekend, there was this question -link- on it and I completely messed up... would have been better to sit down with a pencil and paper before coding, because it became very messy very quickly, whilst the actual solution was super elegant, you just had to spot the 'trick'

        <h3>3. When trying to innovate</h3>
        
        <p>
          I got quite frustrated when I was trying to take the initiative with some improvements I felt were needed, but I mostly got resistance from colleagues and senior colleagues.
          I spoke to some friends about it and... </p>

      What touched me most was his idea that the best way to keep morale high among software developers was, when they develop a system, to start with something that runs (i.e. the main loop), but does absolutely nothing, then slowly start to grow the capability, using mocks interfaces if needed, making sure the whole system is working at every step. Compared to the waterfall approach.
  
      My CTO commented: Definitely. It takes me so long to get into the zone if I can't run what I am working on. Whenever I start something I almost always start with running it and following what it's doing as a kind of way of finding my place. If it just pulled code and couldn't run it I would find it very hard to start working on it.
