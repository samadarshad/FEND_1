      <h2>Some pieces of wisdom from senior developers to junior developers</h2>
      <ol>
      <section>    
        <h3>1. For trying to get into a coding job</h3>
        <p>
          As I was leaving my previous company (due to redudancy), I booked a 1-1 meeting with my CTO to ask for some advice on how I can best tackle my next steps. I firstly realised that firmware engineering probably wasn't for me, and that I'd like to switch to a different industry - web development. He said:. 
        </p>

          <div class="quote-image"></div>
          <div class="quote">
            <p>"<strong>Find your hook.</strong> Most people will take the general full-stack course. But if you can take several extra courses, like front-end, or cloud courses on AWS or Google, depending on the company you're applying to, then that will make you stand out."</p>

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Therefore, if I can learn how to, not only make a fully functioning website, but make it pretty and beautiful, then I think that can give me the "hook" in applying for positions in companies.

        <h3>2. When in the job</h3>
        <p>
          I told my intern during his first day: "I think 50% of the time at work is work, and 50% of time you're just talking about the work.", and he looked at me and laughed. </p>
          <p>
          
          I was working together with Peter, a senior cloud engineer, on creating a CI/CD pipeline for one of our tech stacks. I had briefly discussed the plan of writing a new custom docker image to use for the environment of our pipeline, and he went off and started creating this. The next day I we chatted and I said "whoa whoa just a moment, there was another option - to use an existing, already-maintained, docker image, so that we don't have to maintain our own one."
          We had a reflection after that and he said to me...
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <div class="quote-image"></div>
          <div class="quote">
            <p>"Everyone has a different reality. Its very easy for people to assume things and go off on a race (like me going off and creating a docker image). <strong>Seek first to understand, then to be understood.</strong> This is a 'pipeline' in itself - the sooner the pipeline fails, the better it is for everybody. Software is a conversation."</p>

          Furthermore, I competed in a leetcode -link- competition last weekend, there was this question -link- on it and I completely messed up... would have been better to sit down with a pencil and paper before coding, because it became very messy very quickly, whilst the actual solution was super elegant, you just had to spot the 'trick'

          it doesnt matter if it gets delayed, whats important is that is communicated as early as possible - Tris

          Dont ask "should I do this" or that, it puts too much pressure on the person youre asking. instead say "im going to do X, any pushback?"

          when asking for a favour from someone else, put a deadline on it i.e. instead of "can you review my code?" say "can you review my code, ideally by next tuesday?", this makes it easier for them to prioritise things - because in reality, <strong>what's important for you, may not me their top priority right now</strong>.

        <p>
          Infact, the book, Mythical-Man-Month (see sidebar), agrees with this. The author says when he estimates, he roughly does by: 
          </p>        
          <ul>
            <li>1/3 time to planning</li>
            <li>1/6 to coding</li>
            <li>1/4 component testing</li>
            <li>1/4 system testing</li>
          </ul>   
          <p>       
          in contrast to junior engineers who would just estimate based on coding time (and subsequently always deliver late).
          <strong>The coding is only one-sixth of the time spent!</strong>
        </p>

          I got quite frustrated when I was trying to take the initiative with some improvements I felt were needed, but I mostly got resistance from colleagues and senior colleagues.
