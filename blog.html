      <h2>Three pieces of wisdom from senior developers to junior developers</h2>
      <ol>
      <section>    
        <h3>1. For trying to get into a coding job</h3>
        <p>
          As I was leaving my previous company (due to redudancy), I booked a 1-1 meeting with my CTO to ask for some advice on how I can best tackle my next steps of switching from being a firmware engineer to being a web developer.

          Furthermore the application process, its basically about building trust. Company hire trustworthy and knowledgable people.

        <h3>2. When in the job</h3>
        <p>
          I think atleast 50% of the time at work, you're actually talking about work.
          I was working together with a senior engineer... he went off and started creating a docker image from scratch... I said whoa whoa hold on, there was another option - to use an existing docker image and to just download our dependencies into it.
          We had a reflection after that and he said to me...

          Infact, the book, Mythical-Man-Month (see sidebar), agrees with this. The whole software process is:
          - 3/6 planning
          - 1/6 coding
          - 2/6 testing
          The coding is only 1 sixth of the time spent!

          Furthermore, I competed in a leetcode -link- competition last weekend, there was this question -link- on it and I completely messed up... would have been better to sit down with a pencil and paper before coding, because it became very messy very quickly, whilst the actual solution was super elegant, you just had to spot the 'trick'
